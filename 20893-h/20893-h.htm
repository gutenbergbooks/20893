<h3>
INTRODUCTION
</h3>
<p>
The outlines herewith presented have grown out of the necessities of a course conducted by the writer in the training of teachers in the University of Michigan. The course has been styled &#34;Methods and High School Observations in History.&#34; It has been open only to seniors and graduate students who have specialized in history and who expect to teach that subject in high schools. The work has consisted of one class meeting per week for eighteen weeks, and of twenty hour-observations of history teaching in the Ann Arbor High School. The outlines, therefore, were designed to serve as a guide to these observations and as a basis for subsequent discussions.
</p>
<p>
In order that the students might have a deeper appreciation of the meaning of history and the various conceptions that have been held regarding it, and in order that they might possess at least a general knowledge of the place history has occupied in the schools, the elements composing historical events, and the values attributed to historical study, it seemed appropriate to preface the special queries respecting method by some introductory suggestions of a general character. This fact explains the inclusion of such material as is found in the first few pages of the present booklet.
</p>
<p>
In the hope, therefore, that students of Education in other colleges, universities, and normal schools may find suggestions in the material here brought together, and that teachers in active school work may also receive some practical help therefrom, the writer has been encouraged to place the outlines at the disposal of the public. If they shall prove of service to his colleagues and their students elsewhere, his aim and purpose will be fully met.

<i>
Conceptions of the Purpose and Content of History.</i><a href="#note1" name="noteref1"><small>[1]</small>
</a>
</p>
<p class="first">
1. As polite literature: the Greek and Roman idea, e.g., Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Livy, Sallust, C&#230;sar, Tacitus.
</p>
<p class="first">
2. As annals and chronicles only: the Medi&#230;val idea, e.g., Gregory of Tours, Froissart, Einhard.
</p>
<p class="first">
3. As a basis for governmental policies and as a means of interpreting literature: the Renaissance idea, e.g., Machiavelli, Petrarch, Boccaccio.
</p>
<p class="first">
4. As a basis for theological dogma and religious practices: the Reformation idea, e.g., Luther, Melanchthon, and the Jesuits.
</p>
<p class="first">
5. As a basis for interpreting legal institutions and practices: the idea of the 17th century, e.g., the Jurists.
</p>
<p class="first">
6. As a foundation for philosophical speculation and a means of discovering the deeper influences that affect humanity and hence influence action and produce events: the idea of the 18th century, e.g., Voltaire and Montesquieu. [Voltaire held that human nature is the same under all circumstances and at all times, and hence sought to judge historical events by abstract universal standards. The &#34;natural man&#34; was his ideal man. Montesquieu, in
<i>
The Spirit of the Laws</i>, sought to show that events in history are but the manifestation of spiritual law, as revealed in conditions of climate, geography, soil, natural resources, racial temperament, etc.]
</p>
<p class="first">
7. As a foundation for personal reactions, e.g., criticisms, interpretation, moralizing, personal philosophizing, or as mere facts entertainingly told: the idea of the early 19th century.
</p>
<p class="first">
8. History as science, i.e., as explanatory of existing social institutions, customs, beliefs: the idea of the 20th century.

<i>
Some Notable Influences and Persons that have modified the Conception of the Meaning of History in the Last Century.
</i>
</p>
<p class="first">
&nbsp;1. Romantic School (late 18th century and early 19th century), with its deep reverence for the Middle Ages. Hence sympathetic treatment of history.
</p>
<p class="first">
&nbsp;2. Herder (1744&#8211;1803), with his philosophy of &#34;becoming&#34; or development. Herder sought to show that all events are but the manifestation of a deity striving to work out an ideal universe. Hence all events must be judged by the standards of the time and country in which they appear, i.e., be judged by the characteristics of the age and people affected.
</p>
<p class="first">
&nbsp;3. Hegel (1770&#8211;1831) carried the theory of Herder to more complete conclusions.
</p>
<p class="first">
&nbsp;4. Niebuhr (1776&#8211;1831), &#34;one of the most acute historical critics and philologists of modern times.&#34; Niebuhr was among the first to emphasize the need of a critical examination of source material, and of the building up the past out of these data.
</p>
<p class="first">
&nbsp;5. Ranke, Leopold von (1795&#8211;1886). His aim was to set before the reader the entire picture of events &#34;with their causes, relations, and consequences.&#34;

<p class="second">
(<i>b</i>) In Germany, the systematic study of history in schools really dates from about 1806, though an independent status was given history in the universities (particularly in G&#246;ttingen) in the 18th century.
</p>
<p class="second">
(<i>c</i>) In France, historical study was introduced by Guizot (about 1833) but received no great attention until after 1860, though there was nominally a chair of history in the Coll&#232;ge de France after 1769.
</p>
<p class="second">
(<i>d</i>) In England, none but incidental attention was given historical study until after the middle of the 19th century, though there was a professorship of ancient history at Oxford in 1622, and professorships of modern history were found at both Oxford and Cambridge in 1724.

Methods of Approach to the Study of History.
</i>
</p>
<p class="first">
1. Chronologically, since there is a continuity in the subject, and cause precedes effect. &#34;The childhood of history is best for the child, the boyhood of history for the boy, the youthhood of history for the youth, and the manhood of history for the man.&#34;&#8212;<i>S. S. Laurie</i>, Sch. Rev. 4:650.
</p>
<p class="first">
2. Counter-chronologically, i.e., from the present time and immediate surroundings to remote ages and distant peoples.
</p>
<p class="first">
3. Spirally, i.e., covering the entire field of study in an elementary manner; then repeating the course on a more advanced plane; then taking up the work a third and fourth time, supplementing and expanding with each new attack.
</p>
<p class="first">
4. Biographically, i.e., by means of biographies only.
</p>
<p class="first">
5. Topically, i.e., tracing the development of particular elements in history, continuously and uninterruptedly, from the early stages to complete forms.

3. Is it largely true that the personal or biographic appeals most to the child; the speculative, to the boy; the vitally and concretely constructive, to the youth; and the critical and philosophical to the adult? If so, what should be the character of the work in history in the high school?

The Process of Learning History.
</i>
</p>
<p class="first">
1. Acquiring and relating detailed facts.
</p>
<p class="first">
2. Formulating a mental picture of the events.
</p>
<p class="first">
3. Analyzing the conditions and determining the vital, distinguishing characteristics.
</p>
<p class="first">
4. Getting back of the outer forms, visible expression, or the vital facts to the real life of the people&#8212;their ideals, ideas, emotions, and beliefs.
</p>
<p class="first">
5. Discovering the motives that produced the events considered.
</p>
<p class="first">
6. Deducing the principles that operate in human relations.
</p>
<p class="first">
7. Applying those principles to contemporary civilization to-day, and foreshadowing the probable trend of society in the future.
</p>
<p class="first">
8. Holding consciously to the fact that history is dynamic, not static, i.e., that all historical material constitutes a unity that is revealed under the two laws of continuity and differentiation.
</p>
<p class="indent">
&#34;There are no breaks or leaps in the life of a people. Development may hasten or may slacken, and may seem to cease for a time, but it is always continuous; it always proceeds out of antecedent conditions, and if it be arrested for a time it begins again at the point where it ended.&#34;
</p>
<p class="indent">
&#34;Since the essence of history is the real life of a people&#8212;their ideas and feelings&#8212;history develops as ideas and feelings develop. But thoughts and feelings never exhibit themselves repeatedly in the same forms, but take on new modes of expression in the very process of growth.&#34;&#8212;<i>Mace.

Some Principles of History Dogmatically Stated.
</i>
</p>
<p class="first">
1. &#34;A people's life of thought and feeling obeys the law of continuity and of differentiation. The law of continuity means there are no breaks or leaps in the life of a people. Development may hasten or slacken and may cease for a time, but it is always continuous; the law of differentiation means that thoughts and feelings of a people take on new forms in the process of growth.&#34;&#8212;<i>Mace.
</i>
</p>
<p class="first">
2. History is an evolution&#8212;a continuous movement, and causes always precede effects.
</p>
<p class="first">
3. The historical attitude is this: Ascertainment of facts, interpretation of actions, investigation of motives, but regarding all events as &#34;portions of human life.&#34;
</p>
<p class="first">
4. The notable characteristics of the 19th century are:
</p>
<p class="second">
(<i>a</i>) Rise of nationality.
</p>
<p class="second">
(<i>b</i>) Struggle for constitutional government.
</p>
<p class="second">
(<i>c</i>) Enthusiasm for natural science.
</p>
<p class="second">
(<i>d</i>) Development of the doctrine of evolution.
</p>
<p class="second">
(<i>e</i>) Industrial changes.
</p>
<p class="second">
(<i>f</i>) Economic theory and reform.
</p>
<p class="indent">
Hence, the study of history demands that such items shall be discovered as explain and support these elements.
</p>
<p class="first">
5. It is desirable to develop the historic sense by working outward from the industrial activities of the community.
</p>
<p class="first">
6. It is necessary to reduce diversity to unity.
</p>
<p class="first">
7. &#34;What is logically first in a subject, i.e., the law or principle, comes last into the possession of the unfolding mind.&#34;
</p>
<p class="first">
8. &#34;The worst possible form of education is an abortive education&#8212;one that falls back on some mysterious disciplinary claim for its justification&#8212;as if there were any true discipline in failing to master a subject.&#34;
</p>
<p class="first">
9. &#34;History shows that men's actions are governed by some kind of calculable law.&#34; The problem is to discover these laws.
